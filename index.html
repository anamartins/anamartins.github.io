            <h3>Top Down Sweater Calculator</h3>
            <p>My favourite hooby is knitting. A couple of years ago I have learned how to knit a sweater with the top down techinique. The hardest part is doing the math: some work is required to get all the right numbers. So I have decided to built an calculator to make this easier for my next knit priojects.</p>
            <p>I am learning Vue and this is the first prioject I have done using this framework.</p>

            <h3>Blue Bird Has Told Me</h3>
            <p>I started playing Animal Crossing during spring 2020. I was totally obsessed about the villagers and everything related. I was learning React, so I have decided build a website to show what people are tweeting about the villagers from the game.</p>
            <p>I have built my own REST API called Isabelle & Blatehrs, two cute Animal Crossing NPCs. I did all this some time ago, but it was really fun and I am proud of the result.</p>

            <h3>Some Old Stuff</h3>
            <p>When I was in the beginning of my journey learning how to code some years ago, I did some projects to practice and learn. So I have made a <a href="https://anamartins.github.io/memory-game/" target="_blank">memory game</a>, a <a href="https://anamartins.github.io/shopping-list/" target="_blank">shopping list</a>, a <a href="https://anamartins.github.io/to-do-list/" target="_blank">to do list</a>, and a <a href="https://anamartins.github.io/timer/" target="_blank">timer</a>.</p>
